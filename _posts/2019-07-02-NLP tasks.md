## Introduction

Here we summarize some natural language processing tasks. Compare their semantic level, hardness, and similarity. We rank and group them into a table.

## NLP Tasks

## Summarize

The main tasks include word level tagging, sentence level parsing, text classification, text pair matching (classification, ranking, etc), fine-grained disambiguation or information extraction, and generation.

## Comments

1. We can group tasks according to their semantic-level requirements.
2. We can unify most tasks into generation.

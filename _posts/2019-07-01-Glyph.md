## Problem

Learn Chinese character embedding.

## Key Ideas



## Model

1. Structure

   - Embeddingï¼š character emb + Glove + ELMo
   - Encoder: Multi-layer BiLSTM for each task
   - Decoder: CRF for NER and EMD, Scorer for CR and RE

2. Data

   Use different existing labeled training data

3. Training

   Randomly select task and data batch.

## Tricks

Use BILOU (Beginning, Inside, Last, Outside, Unit) tagging scheme.

## Performance

Get new SOTA performance for NER, EMD, RE.

## Comments

1. Construct task hierarchichy is useful.
2. Multi-task can accelerate training.
3. Combine different layer's embedding can help.
